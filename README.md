# wails-to-wasm

This repository is designed to create files that can be used in creating a web page based on source code (go, html, css) from the [Hello World tutorial](https://wails.io/docs/tutorials/helloworld). This approach uses webAssembly(wasm) technology. It is based on an approach outlined in [this tutorial](https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/) and [it's subsequent tutorial](https://golangbot.com/go-webassembly-dom-access/).

## Testing

Run the commands found in run.sh.

Go to a browser and enter ```localhost:9090``` in the address window.

## Deployment

A example of a deployment method can be found [here][https://github.com/tataDan/wails-to-wasm-app/].
